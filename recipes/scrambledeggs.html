    <p>I have been eating scrambled eggs for daaaays now. 
       Why? Well, they are delicious. Obviously. But also EASY.
       They are perfect for breakfast, lunch, and dinner after all.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup half n half</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li> 1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>black pepper, for serving</li>
        <li>fresh chopper herbs, for serving</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, aggressively whisk together the eggs, half-n-half, 
            and salt until the mixture is uniform in color and texture, and is light and foamy, 
            without any separate streaks of yolk or whites.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in nonstick pan over medium heat</li>
        <li>Add eggs to center of the pan and reduce heat to medium-low</li>
        <li>Wait for the edges to just barely start to set, then using a rubber spatula,
            gently push the eggs from one end of the pan to the other.</li>
        <li>When eggs are mostly cooked, with big pillow-y folds, but still look wet, slowly fold eggs into itself.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat when eggs still shimmer with moisture</li>
        <li>Transfer to serving plates. Finish with pepper and chopped freshed herbs</li>
    </ol>
